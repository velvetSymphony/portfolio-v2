## Life outside IT

Yep! Outside of IT/software engineering, some of my interests include:
- Alpine Trekking/Mountaineering
    - Bonus points if its High Altitude adventuring in and around the Himalayas.
- Winter Sports
    - Snowboarding.
- Music
    - Enjoy all kinds, especially melodious electronic, Alternate Rock, Indie Rock etc
- (Regular) Sports
    - Football (the real one) is probably what I follow the most, though I'm interested in anything.

I write about all the above (atleast hope to!) at [thehobbyistadventurer](https://thehobbyistadventurer.com).

### Mountaineering and trekking in alpine conditions
Alpine and high altitude trekking (and hopefully mountaineering in the near future) is a personal favourite of mine. The feeling is otherworldly (and so is the scenery!), something that I cannot let go of and making me want to return to the mountains. Expect to find some trip reports [here](https://thehobbyistadventurer.com) of my recent adventures.

I have to credit watching documentaries and reading about some of the mountain greats who have inspired me to even consider this as a hobby. Some of the many legends who have definitely inspired me are:

- David Lama
- Hillary Nelson
- Arjun Vajpai
- Ueli Steck 
and many more.

At the time of writing this out (10th February, 2024), most 7000m+ mountains are a distant dream (let alone 8000m ones). 

However in (hopefully) 4 years time with a lot of training and practice climbs, I hope to achieve summiting either of:
- Dhaulagiri VII (Putha Hiunchuli) at approx. 7246m.
- Annapurna IV at approx 7525m.

It's all just words at the moment, but I hope this becomes reality someday.
