#### A peek into myself..
I'm someone who's interested in a little bit of everything; from systems and programming to networks and IAM and even philosophy's such as DevOps. I enjoy crafting scalable, maintainable, and resilient systems. I also dabble with development from time to time (mostly in the form of writing integrations) but mostly spend a lot of time writing scripts and programs to automate as much of my work as possible.

I really enjoy things that challenge me, like figuring out what happens when I run git commands, haha. On a more serious note, I love debugging and solving problems in systems and code, and getting to the bottom of tricky issues. Bring on more of that!

##### Uni days...
Delving more into my personal journey, I'm a masters graduate from the University of New South Wales, Australia in the field of Telecommunications. 
It was an alright course, but what I'm genuinely thankful for my time at uni was when I was introduced to *software defined networking* and cloud computing.
Not that I ended up learning about AWS or anything, but it was a good beginning and one that defintely left an impression on me, making me dig further.
Those couple courses had the right ingredients of all the stuff I enjoyed; networking, AWS, some linux and python. It was hard to go back to just traditional networking at that point, let alone telecommunications.

What started as a personal curiosity for me turned into a full-blown career in DevOps and cloud computing. 
I practically lived the cloud (metaphorically and figuratively), spending countless hours learning the ropes and getting hands-on with some of the coolest (I thought back then) technologies. 
This also helped me prepare for the CCNA and AWS SAA-C02 certifications, which I found to be good approaches to learning more about general technical concepts in IT (more about that in [certifications](./certifications )). 

#### What IT means to me
Right now, I find myself in a place where this isnâ€™t just a job (cliche I know); itâ€™s genuinely something that keeps me hooked. Sure, one day I might look back at this and chuckle at my youthful enthusiasm, but for now, there's a thrill to exploring uncharted territories for myself. Knowing there's things out there that I have no idea about is re-assuring; I'm not going to get bored of this in a very long time haha.

As a segue, what I truly love about IT is its dynamic nature; thereâ€™s always something new waiting to be discovered. Being in this industry sometimes feels like a constant state of euphoria (or, depending on who you ask, a perpetual state of desolation! ðŸ˜‰). And honestly, thereâ€™s something exhilarating about just watching and observing how ideas evolve over time. Itâ€™s all a grand adventure to me.

Which also segue's well into my next part; what I do in my free time. I usually like to go on day hikes and admiring pictures of mountains in the himalayas (where I dream of going everyday. See more in [my blog](https://thehobbyistadventurer.com)).
I do enjoy doing tech stuff in my time off as well. You can find some (pretty useless) projects I work on at [my github](https://github.com/user/velvetSymphony).
